- **Contiguous Memory**: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, meaning all elements are placed next to each other in memory.
- **Direct Access**: Each element in an array can be accessed directly using its index. The index is used to calculate the memory address of the element, based on the base address of the array.
- **Time Complexity**: Accessing an element by index takes constant time, O(1), making array access very efficient.

### **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

- **Static Arrays in Java**: In Java, once you declare an array, the size is fixed. The memory is allocated during runtime when the array is instantiated using `new`.
- **Heap Memory**: Arrays are stored in heap memory, and their references are kept in stack memory. Java doesn't support dynamic resizing of arrays directly, but resizing can be done using data structures like `ArrayList` that handle dynamic memory allocation internally.
  
### **Internal Representation of Array**

- **One-Dimensional Array**: An array is represented as a block of consecutive memory locations. The first memory location stores the first element, the second stores the second element, and so on.
- **Address Calculation**: The address of an element can be calculated as:

```java
  Address = Base Address + (Index * Size of each element)
```
  
  where `Base Address` is the starting address of the array and `Index` is the element's position in the array.
  
  Example: In an integer array `int[] arr = {10, 20, 30}`, if the base address is `1000` and each `int` takes 4 bytes:
  
  - `arr[0]` is at address `1000`
  - `arr[1]` is at address `1004`
  - `arr[2]` is at address `1008`

### **Continuity of an Array**

- **Sequential Storage**: Arrays are stored in continuous memory blocks, which means all elements are next to each other in memory. This continuity allows for efficient access, as the address of any element can be calculated based on the array's base address.

- **Efficiency in Access**: Since elements are stored contiguously, accessing any element via its index is fast, and this is what makes arrays a highly efficient structure for indexed access operations.

### **Index of an Array**

- **Definition**: The index is the position of an element in the array. In Java, array indexing starts from `0`, meaning the first element is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.

- **Accessing Elements**: You can access array elements using their index. For example:
  ```java
  int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30};
  System.out.println(numbers[0]); // Outputs: 10
  ```
- **Out-of-Bounds**: If you try to access an index outside the arrayâ€™s range (e.g., `numbers[3]` in the example above), Java throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

### **String Array**

- **Definition**: A string array is an array that holds `String` values. Strings in Java are objects that represent sequences of characters.

- **Declaration**: You declare a string array the same way as any other array:
  ```java
  String[] names = new String[3]; // An array with 3 empty strings
  ```
- **Initialization**: String arrays can be initialized like this:
  ```java
  String[] fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"};
  ```
- **Accessing String Elements**: You can access and manipulate string elements using the index:
  ```java
  System.out.println(fruits[0]); // Outputs: Apple
  ```

### **What is `null` in Java?**

- **Definition**: In Java, `null` is a special literal that represents the absence of a value or an object. It's used to signify that a variable does not point to any object.

- **Null Variables**: When an object reference (like a `String` or an array) is declared but not initialized, its default value is `null`.
  ```java
  String name; // This is null by default until assigned
  name = null; // Explicitly setting it to null
  ```

### **`null` is Used as a Default**

- **Default Value**: Object references (e.g., arrays, strings, classes) that are not explicitly initialized in Java are automatically set to `null`. Primitive types (like `int`, `double`, etc.) have their own default values (e.g., 0 for `int`).

  ```java
  String[] names = new String[3];
  // At this point, all elements of the array are null
  System.out.println(names[0]); // Outputs: null
  ```
