In programming, organizing data efficiently is crucial for solving problems quickly. Data structures help us manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently, and arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures.

### **Why Do We Need Arrays?**
- **Efficiency**: Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable.
- **Organization**: Instead of creating multiple variables, we can manage related data together.
- **Indexed Access**: Data can be quickly accessed using indexes.

### **What is an Array?**
An array is a collection of elements (values) stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is identified by an index.

### **Syntax of an Array**
In Java, arrays are declared using:

```java
datatype[] arrayName = new datatype[size];
```

- `datatype`: Type of elements (e.g., int, String).
- `arrayName`: The name of the array.
- `size`: The number of elements the array will hold.

### **Direct Hit Program: Store 5 Roll Numbers**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] rollNumbers = new int[5]; // Declare an array of size 5
        rollNumbers[0] = 101;
        rollNumbers[1] = 102;
        rollNumbers[2] = 103;
        rollNumbers[3] = 104;
        rollNumbers[4] = 105;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rollNumbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Roll Number: " + rollNumbers[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

### **How Does an Array Work?**
- **Memory**: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows direct access using an index.
- **Indexing**: The first element is at index 0, second at 1, and so on.
- **Fixed Size**: Arrays are of fixed length, and once created, their size cannot be changed.
