- The **Java Collections Framework** is a set of classes and interfaces that provide a unified architecture to store and manipulate groups of objects.

- It includes **data structures** like lists, sets, queues, and maps that help manage collections of data efficiently.

### Collections Framework 

- A **collection** represents a single unit of objects or elements.
- The **Java Collections Framework** provides built-in implementations for commonly used data structures, reducing the need for custom implementations.
  
### Need for Collection Framework in Java

- **Prior to Collections Framework**, Java used arrays for managing collections of objects, which had limitations such as fixed size, manual management, and lack of advanced functionalities like sorting, searching, or dynamic resizing.

- The **Collections Framework** allows for dynamic manipulation of elements, making it easier to handle operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Understanding the Collection Framework

- The **Collection Interface** serves as the root interface for the framework, which is implemented by various classes such as **ArrayList**, **LinkedList**, **HashSet**, etc.

- It provides methods for fundamental operations like adding, removing, and checking the size of a collection.
