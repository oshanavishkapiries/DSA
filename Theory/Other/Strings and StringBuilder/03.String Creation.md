When a string is created using the `new` keyword in Java, a new `String` object is explicitly created in the **heap memory**. Unlike string literals, which are stored in the **String Pool**, strings created with `new` are not automatically added to the pool unless done so manually.

#### **Key Points:**
- **Heap Memory**: Strings created with `new` are stored in the heap, outside the string pool.
- **Distinct Objects**: Even if two strings have the same content but are created using the `new` keyword, they will be considered distinct objects with different memory addresses.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  String s1 = new String("Java");
  String s2 = new String("Java");
  System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false, different memory locations
  ```

In the example above, although `s1` and `s2` contain the same characters ("Java"), they are different objects in memory because they were created using the `new` keyword. Thus, `s1 == s2` will return `false` because their memory addresses differ.

#### **Why Use the `new` Keyword?**
- **Forcing Heap Allocation**: When you need to ensure that a new instance of the `String` class is created, even if an identical string exists in the string pool, you use the `new` keyword.
- **Explicit Object Creation**: It is useful when you want to make sure each instance of the string is unique and doesn't use pooled memory.
