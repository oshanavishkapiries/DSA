- The **`PrintStream`** class in Java is used for outputting data to a stream, usually to the console or a file.
- It's a subclass of the **`OutputStream`** class, providing methods for writing data (text, numbers, etc.) in a human-readable form.
- The most commonly used instance of `PrintStream` is **`System.out`**, which is used to print data to the console.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports **automatic flushing**: When data is written, the stream can automatically flush the output buffer (optional).
    - **Does not throw I/O exceptions**: Unlike other streams, `PrintStream` methods do not throw `IOException` exceptions.
    - It provides methods like `print()`, `println()`, and `printf()` to print data to the output stream.

#### **Example**:

```java
PrintStream ps = System.out; 
ps.println("Hello, World!"); 
```

- **Common Methods**:
    - `print()`: Prints data without adding a new line.
    - `println()`: Prints data followed by a new line.
    - `printf()`: Prints formatted output using format specifiers (similar to `printf` in C/C++).
