   - **Java Strings** are one of the most commonly used data types in Java.
   - A string represents a sequence of characters.
   - In Java, the `String` class is defined in `java.lang` package and is immutable by design.
   - Strings are widely used in Java for everything from input/output handling to file processing, and web services.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Strings are objects.
     - They can store textual data like "Hello World."
     - A string literal in Java can be defined using double quotes (`" "`).

### **2. What is String?**

   - **String** in Java is a class that represents a sequence of characters (such as words or sentences).
   - A **String** is treated as an object in Java.
   - It is a **final class**, meaning it cannot be subclassed.
   - The `String` class implements the **CharSequence** and **Serializable** interfaces, which means it can be used to represent character sequences and can also be serialized.

   - Example: 
     ```java
     String s = "Hello, Java!";
     ```
 
   - Strings are used for representing textual data like words, sentences, or even larger blocks of text.

### **3. String Creation: String Literal**


   - A **String literal** is a string value that is directly written in double quotes in the code.
   - Java automatically handles the creation and management of string literals by using a **String Pool** (discussed later).

   - **Example of String literal**:
     ```java
     String str = "Hello World";
     ```
 
   - If a string literal is repeated multiple times in code, Java does not create new objects. Instead, it reuses the existing literal from the **String Pool**, optimizing memory usage.

### **4. Internal Working of String**


   - Internally, **String** objects are stored as **character arrays** (`char[]`), though this is now encapsulated in newer versions.

   - When a `String` is created, a **reference** to the object is stored, not the object itself. The actual string data is stored in memory, and Java manages the memory using **String Pooling** (covered below).

   - Strings in Java are immutable, which means that once a string is created, its content cannot be changed. Any operation that tries to modify a string creates a **new string** object in memory.

   - This immutability allows strings to be safe for use in multi-threaded environments, as no two threads can modify the same string object.

### **5. String Pooling**

   - **String Pool** is a special memory region in the **Heap** that stores string literals.

   - When a new string literal is created, Java first checks if an identical string already exists in the pool:
     - If it exists, the new reference points to the already existing string.
     - If it doesnâ€™t exist, a new string object is created in the pool.

   - The concept of string pooling helps **optimize memory usage** because strings are commonly used, and it prevents the creation of multiple identical string objects.

   - Example:
```java
     String s1 = "Java";
     String s2 = "Java";     
```

 In this case, both `s1` and `s2` will point to the same memory location in the pool.

### **6. String Immutability**

   - **Immutability** means that once a `String` object is created, it cannot be modified.

   - Every time you try to modify a string (e.g., concatenate or replace characters), a **new string object** is created, and the original string remains unchanged.
   
   - This design choice ensures **security** and **thread-safety**, as strings are often used in multi-threaded environments (e.g., for passing data).
   
   - Benefits of immutability:
     1. **Performance**: Allows for efficient use of the **String Pool**.
     2. **Security**: Makes strings secure for operations like passwords and database connections.
     3. **Consistency**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe, meaning they can be shared without synchronization.


   - Example:
     ```java
     String str = "Hello";
     str = "world";
     ```
   - In the above case, `"Hello World"` is a new string object. The original `"Hello"` remains unchanged.
